# [201_84] Fix "Prefix by section number" not applying to Question/Answer environments

## Issue
#2806 — The "Prefix by section number" style option works for Theorem and Proposition but does not apply to Question and Answer environments.

## Root Cause
In `env-theorem.ts`, Question and Answer were created with `new-remark` (adding them to `theorem-env` counter group) and then `individual-counter` was called to give them separate counters. However, `individual-counter` replaces `display-question` with the raw identity function, which breaks the display chain:

```
display-question → display-in-theorem-env → display-std-env → section-prefix + nr
```

After `individual-counter`, the chain becomes just `display-question → identity(nr)`, losing the section prefix.

## Fix
1. Created a new `question-env` counter group in `env-base.ts` as a sub-group of `std-env` with `group-individual-counters` (following the same pattern as `exercise-env`)
2. Added a `new-question` macro that uses `question-env` for counters and `render-remark` for visual rendering
3. Changed Question/Answer from `new-remark` + `individual-counter` to `new-question`

This preserves individual counters while maintaining the proper display chain for section prefixing.

- `TeXmacs/packages/environment/env-theorem.ts`

## How to Test
1. Create a new document with article style
2. Add chapters/sections with Question environments inside them
3. Open style options (the wrench icon on the focus toolbar)
4. Enable "Prefix by section number"
5. Verify that Question numbers now show section prefix (e.g., "Question 1.1." instead of "Question 1.")
6. Verify that Answer numbers also show section prefix
7. Verify that Theorem/Proposition still work correctly with section prefix
