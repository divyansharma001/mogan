### Fixes 

Issue #2846 : need to install unzip or 7zip before 'xmake build stem'

---

### Summary

Update the Quick Start installation section in `README.md` to link to platform-specific development guides.

---

### Changes

- Removed direct build command (`xmake build stem`) from `README.md`.
- Added links to:
  - GNU/Linux Development Guide
  - Windows Development Guide
  - macOS Development Guide
  
---

### Reason

Platform-specific setup instructions are already documented in the respective development guides. Linking to them avoids duplication and keeps the README clean and minimal.
