# [201_85] Matrices and determinants should not be resizable by mouse drag

## How to Test
1. Insert a matrix (`Insert` -> `Table` -> `Matrix`) and click inside it
2. Verify that no resize handles appear around the matrix
3. Hover over the internal grid lines of the matrix — the cursor should remain normal (no resize cursor)
4. Try dragging a grid line inside the matrix — it should not resize
5. Repeat the above for `det`, `bmatrix`, `Bmatrix`, `choice`, and `stack`
6. Insert a normal table (`Insert` -> `Table` -> `Plain tabular`) — resize handles and line dragging should still work as before

## Issue
#2783 — Matrices and determinants can be resized by dragging the mouse, which should not be allowed.

### What
The table resizing feature (drag grid lines, scale handles) was incorrectly applying to mathematical table environments like `matrix`, `det`, `bmatrix`, `Bmatrix`, `choice`, and `stack`. These are mathematical constructs where resizing by mouse drag is not meaningful.

### How
1. In `edit_interface.cpp`, added `matrix`, `matrix*`, `bmatrix`, `Bmatrix`, `det`, `choice`, and `stack` to the `is_true_table` exclusion list. This prevents scale resize handles from appearing on these math table types (the handle drawing code already checks `is_true_table`).
2. In `edit_mouse.cpp` `table_line_start`, added an `is_true_table` guard so that internal grid line dragging is blocked for math tables.
3. In `edit_mouse.cpp` `mouse_any`, added an `is_true_table` check before setting the `hovering_table` cursor style, so the resize cursor (↔/↕) no longer appears when hovering over matrix/det grid lines.
