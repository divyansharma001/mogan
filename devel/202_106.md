# [202_106] Cmd+V paste not working in macOS save file dialog

### How to test
1. Open Mogan on macOS
2. Copy some text to the clipboard
3. Open **Save As** dialog (File → Save as)
4. In the filename text field, press **Cmd+V** to paste
5. Verify the clipboard text is pasted into the filename field
6. Also verify **Cmd+C**, **Cmd+X**, **Cmd+A** work in the dialog
7. After closing the dialog, verify editor shortcuts still work normally

### What
Temporarily disable QAction keyboard shortcuts while a native file dialog is open on macOS, then restore them after the dialog closes.

### Why
On macOS, QAction shortcuts registered in the menu bar are converted to NSMenuItem key equivalents. When a native file dialog (NSSavePanel/NSOpenPanel) is shown via `QFileDialog::exec()`, pressing Cmd+V triggers the QAction for "Paste" in Mogan's menu bar instead of the standard Cocoa `paste:` action in the dialog's text field. This prevents users from pasting filenames in the Save As dialog.

The `ShortcutOverride` mechanism in `QTMWidget::event()` does not help here because the QTMWidget does not have focus while a modal dialog is open.

### How
In `qt_chooser_widget_rep::perform_dialog()` in `src/Plugins/Qt/qt_chooser_widget.cpp`:

- Before `dialog->exec()`: on macOS (`Q_OS_MACOS`), iterate all `QAction`s in the active window, save their shortcuts, then clear them via `action->setShortcut(QKeySequence())`
- After `dialog->exec()` returns: restore all saved shortcuts

This removes the NSMenuItem key equivalents while the dialog is open, allowing the native dialog to process standard editing shortcuts (Cmd+V/C/X/A) through the Cocoa responder chain.
