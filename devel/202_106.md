# [202_106] Fix duplicate names in table environment switching dropdown

### How to test
1. Open Mogan
2. Insert a table using `Alt+t`
3. Click the "tabular" dropdown on the focus toolbar
4. Verify all 6 variants have distinct names:
   - 小表格 (small table)
   - 大表格 (big table)
   - 无框表格 (tabular)
   - 居中无框表格 (centered tabular)
   - 有框表格 (block)
   - 居中有框表格 (centered block)

### What
Added `focus-tag-name` overrides for `tabular*` and `block*` in `TeXmacs/progs/table/table-menu.scm` so they display as "centered tabular" and "centered block" respectively.

### Why
The `focus-tag-name` function strips the `*` suffix from `tabular*` and `block*` (treating them as unnumbered variants of `tabular` and `block`), causing both pairs to display the same name in the table variant dropdown. This results in two duplicate entries: "无框表格" appears twice and "有框表格" appears twice.

The fix adds explicit `focus-tag-name` dispatches for these two tags, using translation keys ("centered tabular" / "centered block") that already exist in all language dictionaries.
